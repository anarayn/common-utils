# common-utils
A collection of utilities which I've created/adapted over time, most of them are wrappers over standard
libraries available customised for my convenience. Some of these are:
1) StringUtils
2) NumberUtils
3) CollectionUtils
4) DateUtils
5) XMLParser
6) ReflectionUtils
7) JsonUtils
8) ExponentialBackOff
